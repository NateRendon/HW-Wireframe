   <h2>Nathan Rendon </h2>

    <div id="h2"> </div>
    <div>
    <p>"Hi I'm Nathan."</p>  
        <p>I like video games, card games, and meeting new people.</p> 
           <p> I also tend to have random saying such as "Hi I'm Nathan" as sort of an inside joke among friends, 
         so if i say something random like that then it is a force of habit. I cant wait to get to know more people!</p>
