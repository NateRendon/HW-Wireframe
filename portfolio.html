            <p>"Hi I'm Nathan."</p>  
            <p>I like video games, card games, and meeting new people.</p> 
            <p> I have a very large interest in the world of technology, starting with web development, and stretching as far as to hopefully ending
                up with hologram development. It's always been a dream of mine to not only create things through technology but also visually
                   see them come to life. One day I will see that dream realized, and until that day I will work hard to see it come to life.
                   When with friends I tend to have random saying such as "Hi I'm Nathan" as sort of an inside joke among friends, 
             so if i say something random like that then it is a force of habit. I cant wait to get to know more people!
